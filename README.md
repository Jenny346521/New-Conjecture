The maple file "VerifyConjecture.mw" is a worksheet for checking Conjecture 12 in the paper
"Inequalities among Symmetric Polynomial Functions: Counter-examples and New Conjectures".

To run "VerifyConjecture.mw", you need to download "Hsymmetric" and "tsds6", and make sure that all 
three files are in the same folder. 

"Hsymmetric" is for generating complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials H(n, a) in n variables. 
"tsds6" is a tool for decisiding nonnegativity of polynomials by using difference substitution method.

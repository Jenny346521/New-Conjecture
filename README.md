The maple file "VerifyConjecture.mw" is a worksheet for checking Conjecture 12 in the paper
"Inequalities among Symmetric Polynomial Functions: Counter-examples and New Conjectures".

To run "VerifyConjecture.mw", you need to download "Hsymmetric" and "tsds6", and make sure that all 
three files are in the same folder. 

"Hsymmetric" generates complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials H(n, a) in n variables. 
"tsds6" determines nonnegativity of polynomials by using the difference substitution method.
